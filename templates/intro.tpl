<p>This page offers an interface on the application that exports data from the [colEdition] in the 
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/gbif-ecat/wiki/DwCArchive">Darwin Core Archive format</a>. Data can also
be exported using <a href="[webserviceUrl]">a webservice</a>. The resulting archives can be imported into 
custom MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite and MS SQL Server databases using these 
<a href="includes/download.php?file=scripts">import scripts</a>.</p>

<p>The export can be narrowed down to a specific taxon by selecting it from the menus. E.g. if you want
to limit your export to a specific order, you can select that order from the menu by typing its name
or by clicking the Show all button. By default, the complete data is exported but you can further limit
the export by selecting a different option. Hover over the buttons to see exactly what is exported for
each option.</p>
