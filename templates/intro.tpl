<p style="margin-top: 20px;">This page offers a very basic temporary interface on the application that 
exports data from the Catalogue of Life v1.6 (the 2011 DVD editon) 
in the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gbif-ecat/wiki/DwCArchive">Darwin Core Archive format</a>.</p>

<p>This service can be used to create a block level III download of the Catalogue of Life Dataset. 
This is the so-called &lsquo;naked checklist&rsquo;, plus common names and distribution. 
See the &lsquo;Download and Piping Tools Specifications, Deliverable 2.1&rsquo; (28 April 2011) document 
for more information or <a href="documentation/blocks.rtf">read the block definition</a>.</p>

<p>Download a Darwin Core Archive for the <a href="zip-fixed/archive-complete.zip">complete Catalogue of Life</a> 
(89 MB), or select a rank from the popup menu and enter a taxon name to start the export. 
The name should match exactly, wildcards are not allowed. Note that the higher the rank, 
the longer the export process will take.</p>
